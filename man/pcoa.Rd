\description{
Nothing to import, because ape doesn't (yet) export this S3 class.
We will define it here, but keep it internal.
For the moment, its only use is for proper dispatch in our extensions
to the scores S3 generic from vegan,
for generic extraction of coordinates and possibly other features from
any ordination results.
